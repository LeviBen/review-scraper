Samuel Bard,"Feb 27, 2025",1,"Be careful with companies like this. When you apply for an SBA loan, they will first require you to take out small MCA loans from them and provide pre-approval letters. Then, they will put your business in a critical situation, make you look like a fool, and disappear—leaving you with nothing but high-interest debt.

I worked with them for over three months to apply for an SBA loan, and now my application has been denied. I’m struggling with high-interest loans, and they have vanished—no calls, no messages.

I’m writing this review to warn everyone: stay away from these people to avoid ending up in the same situation as me. Date of experience: February 27, 2025 Reply from Premium Merchant Funding We’re very sorry to hear about your experience and truly regret that we fell short of your expectations.

Samuel Bard,"May 2, 2025",1,"Update: in 2025, I came to a mutual agreement with this company. But only weeks later, I continued to be contacted, I let them know- and they didn’t even have the audacity to respond or reply.

In 2024, I began receiving unsolicited emails, text messages, phone calls, and other forms of communication from representatives of this company. These messages arrived at all hours, including well beyond normal business hours and past the acceptable timeframe for contacting a potential lead or customer.

I have never applied for a business loan with this company, nor have I ever provided my personal cell phone number for business-related purposes. Despite this, I was bombarded with near-daily text messages from different representatives. After enduring this persistent harassment, I emailed the company requesting that they remove my information and cease all further contact.

Instead of honoring my request, they absurdly asked me to comb through my messages and calls, identify the names and numbers of their representatives, and report them individually—an unreasonable burden that they should have addressed through their own records and CRM system. Rather than taking responsibility, they expected me to do their work for them.

That was in December 2024. Yet, despite my explicit request, the messages continued in blatant violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA).

When I followed up once again demanding that they stop, the company had the audacity to claim that the individuals contacting me were not their employees. I immediately provided multiple examples of these individuals using company email addresses, exposing their outright dishonesty. A quick look at other complaints—not just on this platform, but also on Google and Yelp—reveals a clear pattern of the same unethical behavior toward others.

This is not an isolated incident; it is a systemic issue within the company’s culture. To this day, they have failed to explain how they obtained my personal information, which raises serious privacy concerns. Their refusal to take responsibility or provide a clear answer is completely unacceptable. Date of experience: January 28, 2025 Reply from Premium Merchant Funding We’re very sorry to hear about your experience and appreciate you taking the time to share your concerns.

We take matters of communication consent and data privacy extremely seriously. While we cannot speak to the specifics of your case publicly, we want to make clear that it is never our intention to make anyone feel harassed or disrespected. Our team is trained to follow all relevant compliance protocols, including those outlined by the TCPA.

We understand your frustration and regret any inconvenience this has caused. Since your initial request, we have implemented additional safeguards to ensure that opt-out requests are handled swiftly and comprehensively across all contact points. We are currently reviewing this matter internally to ensure it does not happen again.

If you are still receiving messages or would like us to confirm removal of your information across our systems, please reach out to us directly at help@pmfus.com so we can resolve this promptly and completely.

We are committed to earning trust the right way, and we genuinely regret that your experience fell short of that.
