Jeremy Chiprin has really done great for me. He asked good questions to understand my needs, and he came back pretty quickly with several options.  I was worried that this was going to be complex but Jeremy made it quite simple. I would highly recommend working with him.

Joseph Heres,"Feb 10, 2024",1,"Our small business had a cash-flow issue. I was contacted by Joseph Heres at PMF, he offered a solution that included a short-term cash influx via MCA, which came with high daily payments. This, he assured me, would be then paid off with a longer-term loan that would consolidate all our debt into on affordable monthly payment. I moved forward on this solution. Turned out, he couldn't (or didn't try to) get the longer-term consolidation loan for me, so now I'm stuck with high daily payments on a very expensive MCA. He completely screwed our little company and will no longer respond to my attempts to reach him. Date of experience: February 01, 2024",Trustpilot
Marcus Hoffman,"Mar 31, 2021",5,"Review of Marcus Hoffman

Very Responsive: From the 1st call back in July 2020 to Current. He gets back to me immediately and is successful at his task and loans.
Thorough: Seems to ask all the right questions to get project (loan) done in record time.
Experienced
Professional each time I call or text, I get a response immediately.
Educated
Gets things done!

Back in July 2020, Marcus reached out to me along with 20 others who call every day. Marcus promised the world and delivered. I was able to receive a MCA Loan and EIDL Loan on our First Round. He later helped repair my Credit which opened up more loan options including a PPP.

This Guy is Amazing! My one and Only Loan Guy!

Sincerely,
Michael G. Moxley Date of experience: April 01, 2021",Trustpilot
