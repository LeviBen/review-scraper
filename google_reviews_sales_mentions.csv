In my business, recent events have made inventory decisions more challenging.  I called Premium Merchant Funding to help.  Jeremy Chiprin was able to provide several interim solutions for me.  He quickly answered my questions and reduced my anxiety.   I highly recommend you call if in need of a temporary cash infusion.
